# A tiny radio relay website

This is a WIP website with a couple of my favorite radio stations to be optimized for using on a KaiOS device via built-in browser. It could have been an app, but for reasons unknown the manufacturers and the KaiOS company do not make it easy or sometimes even possible to get into development.
