# A tiny radio relay website

This is a small website with a couple of my favorite radio stations optimized for a "dumbphone" browser (specifically for KaiOS 2.5.1 browser based on Gecko 48). It could have been an app, but for reasons unknown the manufacturers and the KaiOS company do not make it easy or even possible to get into development.

The app is availble [here](https://monkfish-app-4larl.ondigitalocean.app/) or via a short link: https://rb.gy/hxm41.

## Features

* Vanilla JavaScript
* Optimized for Gecko (Firefox) 48 engine: no async/await, fetch API or other modern JavaScript
* Now playing information available
* Tested on Nokia 800 Tough
